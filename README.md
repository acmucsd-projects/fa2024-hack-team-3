# **ðŸ“– StudyLink Application**

StudyLink is a platform designed to streamline the process for students to find and connect with study partners with ease. 
By fostering a collaborative and friendly learning environment (without the awkwardness), StudyLink makes it easier than ever for students to collaborate, discuss about school life, and excel academically together.
